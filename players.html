                        <p class="text">The Monument strikes fear into the opposing teams eyes. 
                            Big men dispise playing against the 5'5" beast becuse they 
                            know they will be taking elbows to the ribs all game. No 
                            one knows why people call him The Monument but the rumor is he 
                            made it up himself. His efficient jumpshot will complete any 
                            team in The Yard.</p>

                        <p class="text">Terech played center for two years on his highschool varsity 
                            team, hence the nickanme Fundamental. While playing the five 
                            at 6'1" it was a necessitty that Terech played sound 
                            fundamental basketball. Occasionally, Terech shows 
                            flashes of his athletic ability he had in highschool. 
                            Those sights are far and few between but the fundamentals 
                            are always there.</p>

                        <p class="text">Whatever type of weather there is you can expect Coop to 
                            be in The Yard. Rumor has it he hoops with gloves on 
                            in the snow. Some say he works too hard, he would say he 
                            doesn't work hard enough. No one knows if Coop owns any 
                            shirt because he never has one on in The Yard.</p>

                        <p class="text">Unlike The Monument, the nickname Bunnies was earned, 
                            not given. He is by far the most athletic player in 
                            The Yard. No other washed up athlete comes close to 
                            matching Jasica's jumping abilities. Jasica's is a 
                            player favorite because it means the rest of the team 
                            won't have to work for rebounds.</p>

                        <p class="info">Forward / 6'4" / 180</p>
                        <p class="text">Although Baldwin does not enjoy playing in the paint, 
                            he spends almost all of his time there because he is 
                            stuck guarding the other team's tallest player. 
                            If it was up to him, Baldwin would spend his time on 
                            the 3-point line, stroking threes with his buttery release. 
                            You know Baldwin is getting serious when he walks out with 
                            his 90s headband that has not been washed in years.</p>

                        <p class="info">Guard / 5'10" / 190</p>
                        <p class="text">While Roach might appear to have hops in the logo of Backyard 
                            Top Shot, the rest of The Yard knows he was three inches off 
                            of the ground. Roach's jumper is smooth as a baby's bottom. 
                            If there were refs in The Yard, Roach would foul out of every 
                            game in the first minute. That doesn't stop him from getting 
                            physical in The Yard. </p>
